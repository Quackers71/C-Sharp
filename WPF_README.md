## Notes throughout the book / Course from WPF version

### Start diving into code with WPF projects.

The second chapter gets you started writing C# code, and most<br>
of the chapter is focused around building Windows Store apps.

We recommend that you do the following:

* Read Chapter 2 in the main part of the book through
  page 68.
* We provide a replacement for page 69 in this appendix.<br>
  After that, you can read pages 70, 71, and 72 in the book.
* Then there are replacements for pages 73 and 74, where<br>
  you build a program from scratch. You can follow the<br>
  rest of the project in the book.
* The book will work just fine for you through page 82.
* There’s an exercise on page 83, and its solution is on page<br> 
  85. We provide replacements for those pages in this PDF.

Once you finish that exercise, the chapter no longer requires any<br>
Windows Store apps or Windows 8. You’ll be able to continue<br>
on in the book through Chapter 9, and you can do the first and<br>
second labs.
