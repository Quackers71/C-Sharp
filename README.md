 - Chapter 3 - Classes, Objects, Methods & more...
   When you create a new object from a class, it’s called an instance of that class.
   Methods are what an object does. Fields are what the object knows.
   An object’s behavior is defined by its methods, and it uses fields to keep track of its state.
   When your program creates a new object, it gets added to the heap.
